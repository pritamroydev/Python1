what are errors?
- these are those problems which stop our program to run smoothly


1- compile-time error
2- runtime error
3- logical error


errors in software - "bugs"
fixing those bugs in software - "debugging"




exception ->
1- start running
2- warning sign
3- catch and handle, program crash


exception handling?

using "try-except" block


finally block->
it executes no matter what




nested try-except block->
similar to nested loops
