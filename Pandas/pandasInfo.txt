Key Concepts:


Series: 

- It is a 1-D labelled array that can hold any data type: integer, floats, strings, or even Python Objects. Each element in the Series has a unique label called an index.

- often used to track changes or patterns over time, such as daily temperatures, stock prices or sales revenue.


Dataframe:

- It is a 2-D labelled data structure in Pandas, similar to tables in a database, an Excel spreadsheet, or a SQL table.

- It consists of row & column, where:
    a. Rows have indices(labels)
    b. Columns have names(labels)
